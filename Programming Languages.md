A programming language is a system of notation for writing computer programs.

Programming languages are described in terms of their [[Syntax]] (form) and [[semantics]] (meaning), usually defined by a formal language. Languages usually provide features such as a type system, variables and mechanisms for error handling. An implementation of a programming language in the form of a compiler or interpreter allows programs to be executed, either directly or by producing an executable.
